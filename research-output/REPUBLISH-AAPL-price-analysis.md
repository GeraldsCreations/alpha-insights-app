## Current Price Analysis

**Current Price:** $259.48 (+1.20, +0.46% today)  
**After Hours:** $258.99 (-0.19%)  
**52-Week Range:** $169.21 - $288.62  
**Trading at:** 10.1% below 52-week high, 53.4% above 52-week low

**Recent Action (1-7 days):**
AAPL rallied +4.61% over the past week, bouncing strongly from the $252 support zone after delivering blowout Q1 earnings on Jan 29. Revenue hit a record $143.8B (best quarter ever), with iPhone sales surging 23% to $85.3B. The stock gapped higher from $255.16 open to close at $259.48, testing but failing to break through the $262 resistance level. Price action shows buyers stepping in aggressively at the $252-255 zone. Management guided 13-16% revenue growth for Q2, but AI monetization timeline remains vague, limiting upside momentum. Recent consolidation between $250-$262 suggests indecision before next directional move.

**Volume Analysis:**
Exceptionally bullish volume confirmation. Trading volume spiked to 92.4M shares (197% of 30-day average of 46.9M), indicating strong institutional accumulation on the earnings beat. This represents the highest relative volume reading in recent weeks. Volume surge coinciding with price advance from $252 to $261 confirms genuine buying interest, not just technical bounce. The distribution pattern shows accumulation (buying on strength), not distribution (selling into strength). This is a textbook bullish volume signature for a breakout setup.

**Momentum Indicators:**
- **RSI (14):** 48.44 - Neutral zone with room to run in either direction. Not overbought (>70) or oversold (<30).
- **Moving Averages:** Price trading 0.71% above SMA20 (short-term bullish), but -3.29% below SMA50 (intermediate resistance ahead). However, stock remains +9.65% above SMA200, confirming long-term uptrend intact.
- **ATR (14):** $5.50 - Average daily range suggests moderate volatility, typical for AAPL
- **Volatility:** 2.36% (daily) / 2.04% (weekly) - Low volatility environment, potential energy building for larger move

**Momentum Assessment:** Neutral-to-bullish. RSI in middle range provides runway for upside continuation if volume sustains. MACD not provided but moving average structure (above 200-day, approaching 50-day) suggests rebuilding bullish momentum after recent pullback.

**Key Levels:**
- **Resistance:** $262 (intraday high rejected), $270 (psychological), $280 (gap fill), $288.62 (52-week high)
- **Support:** $252 (last week's low, strong buyer interest), $245 (deeper pullback zone), $235 (critical support), $220 (major support from October rally base)

**Unusual Activity:**
- **Volume spike:** 197% of average on earnings day signals institutional buying
- **Analyst upgrades:** JPMorgan raised target to $325, Wedbush to $350, Maxim Group upgraded to Buy with $300 target
- **Insider activity:** Minimal recent insider selling, last major sale Oct 2025 by CEO Cook (routine planned sale)
- **Options flow:** Not captured in data, but earnings beat typically triggers call buying
- **Strategic news:** $2B acquisition of AI startup Q.ai reported; Google partnership for AI features (Gemini integration into iOS)
- **Supply constraints:** Management cited memory chip shortages may prioritize premium iPhone 17 models over standard versions

**Price Action Bias:** **Neutral-to-Bullish**

Current price action leans slightly bullish based on:
1. Volume-confirmed bounce from support
2. Earnings beat with strong guidance
3. Defending key $252 support zone
4. RSI neutral with upside room
5. Above long-term 200-day moving average

However, caution warranted due to:
1. Failed breakout above $262 resistance
2. Trading below 50-day moving average (overhead supply)
3. Tepid price reaction to blockbuster earnings (up only 0.46%)
4. AI monetization timeline uncertainty
5. Supply chain constraints flagged by management

**Entry/Exit Zones:**
- **Entry (Aggressive):** $255-$258 on pullback to today's open area, or $259-$260 on breakout confirmation above $262
- **Entry (Conservative):** $250-$252 if retesting last week's support with volume drying up
- **Stop Loss:** $248 (below key support cluster, limits risk to 3-4%)
- **Target 1:** $270 (psychological level, +4% from current)
- **Target 2:** $280 (gap fill to November highs, +8%)
- **Target 3:** $295 (analyst consensus target, +14%)

**Confidence Level:** **Medium-High**

**Rationale:** High volume accumulation and earnings beat provide bullish foundation, but muted price response to record results suggests market skepticism around AI story. Neutral RSI and consolidation pattern could resolve either way. Risk/reward favors bulls above $252 support, but wait for $262 breakout or $250 retest for optimal entry timing. Strong support structure below limits downside risk, making this a favorable risk/reward setup for patient entries.

## Summary for Report Writer

AAPL delivered its best quarter ever with $143.8B revenue and iPhone growth of 23%, but stock reaction was muted (+0.46%), closing at $259.48. Price defended critical $252 support on explosive volume (197% of average), confirming institutional buying. However, failure to break $262 resistance shows hesitation around AI monetization timeline. RSI at 48.44 (neutral) provides room for upside if momentum builds. Trading above 200-day MA (+9.65%) but below 50-day MA (-3.29%), creating tug-of-war between short-term resistance and long-term uptrend. Key support at $252, key resistance at $262. Entry favored at $250-$252 pullback or $262 breakout, targeting $270-$280. Risk/reward tilts bullish above $252, but patience required for clearer directional signal. Memory chip constraints and premium iPhone prioritization add supply uncertainty. Medium-high confidence in setup given strong support structure and volume confirmation, but AI skepticism caps immediate upside.

**Next Steps:** Monitor $262 resistance for breakout confirmation or $252 support retest. Watch for AI product announcements (Apple Intelligence rollout timeline) and iPhone 17 launch details. Track analyst revisions post-earnings and options flow for sentiment shifts.
