## 📊 Multi-Timeframe Verdicts

### 5-Min
**Verdict:** HOLD 🟡  
**Confidence:** 55  
**Reasoning:** Intraday consolidation near $259.48 with neutral momentum and no clear directional catalyst. Scalpers should wait for $262 breakout or $257 breakdown before entering directional trades.

### 15-Min
**Verdict:** BUY 🟢  
**Confidence:** 62  
**Reasoning:** Building ascending base with volume expansion suggests preparation for upside move. Entry at current levels targets $263-265 resistance test within 2-4 hours.

### 1-Hour
**Verdict:** BUY 🟢  
**Confidence:** 71  
**Reasoning:** Institutional accumulation visible on 92.4M volume spike positions favorably for $265-270 resistance test. Risk-reward supports entries at $258-260 targeting same-day breakout.

### 4-Hour
**Verdict:** BUY 🟢  
**Confidence:** 78  
**Reasoning:** Consolidation at 23.6% Fib retracement forms textbook continuation pattern with measured move to $280-295. Breakout above $270 triggers multi-day rally toward analyst price targets.

### Daily
**Verdict:** BUY 🟢  
**Confidence:** 83  
**Reasoning:** Record $143.7B quarterly revenue with supply-driven constraints creates bullish setup as production scales through Q2-Q3. Trading above 200-day MA (+9.65%) with February Gemini-Siri catalyst imminent supports swing positions targeting $285-305.

### Weekly
**Verdict:** BUY 🟢  
**Confidence:** 87  
**Reasoning:** Analyst targets of $300-325 reflect 15-25% upside driven by iPhone Fold, AI platform transition, and pent-up demand release. Product roadmap (Gemini Siri, M5/M6 Macs, iPhone Fold) positions for multi-quarter outperformance despite supply headwinds.

## 🎯 Final Assessment

**Primary Thesis:** Apple's record earnings driven by supply constraints—not demand weakness—create a paradoxically bullish setup. When production catches up to demand in Q2-Q3, revenue could accelerate beyond current estimates. Institutional accumulation at 97% above-average volume signals smart money positioning ahead of breakout.

**Trade Strategy:**  
- **Aggressive:** Enter now at $259-260, add on $265 breakout, target $280-295 (stop: $250)  
- **Conservative:** Wait for $265-270 breakout confirmation, target $285-305 (stop: $258)  
- **Long-Term:** Accumulate $250-260 range, hold through 2026 product cycle toward $325 targets

**Invalidation:** Break below $250 on volume negates bullish thesis and opens door to $240-243 retest.
