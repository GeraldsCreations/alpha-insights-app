**Technical Bias:** **Bullish**

**Key Notes:**
- **Geopolitical Risk Premium:** Oil rally strongly influenced by US-Iran tensions and concerns over Strait of Hormuz shipping disruptions. This factor provides fundamental support but introduces headline risk.
- **Supply Constraints:** Production outages in Kazakhstan, Venezuela issues, and US production freeze-offs creating supply-side tightness.
- **Volume Confirmation:** 91.31K volume on current session shows healthy participation, validating the move higher.
- **Momentum Strength:** +13.57% monthly gain is the strongest monthly performance since July 2023, indicating powerful trend acceleration.
- **Risk Factors:** Geopolitical de-escalation could trigger sharp reversal. Monitor Iran-US diplomatic developments closely.
- **Seasonal Pattern:** February-March historically shows mixed performance for oil; current geopolitical premium overrides typical seasonality.
- **Confluence Zone:** Multiple technical factors align bullishly - ascending channel, MACD crossover, rising 50 MA, Fib extensions all point to $67-72 target zone.

**Volatility Assessment:** 
Elevated volatility expected to continue given geopolitical uncertainties. Day range of $62.07-$63.17 ($1.10 or 1.7%) indicates increased intraday swings. Traders should use wider stops and manage position size accordingly.

**Short-Term Outlook (1-2 weeks):**
Expect consolidation in $61.50-$63.50 range as market digests recent gains before potential breakout toward $67-68. Watch for flag pattern resolution. Bullish bias maintained above $60. Breakout above $63.50 with volume confirmation would trigger acceleration toward $66-67 zone rapidly.

**Confidence Level:** **High**

The technical setup is strongly bullish with multiple confirming indicators, clear trend structure, and well-defined support/resistance levels. The primary risk remains geopolitical headline sensitivity, but the technical structure suggests the path of least resistance is higher. Risk/reward favors long positions with proper stop placement below key support zones.
