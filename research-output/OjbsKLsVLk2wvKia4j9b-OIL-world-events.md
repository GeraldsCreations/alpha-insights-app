## World Events & Macro Context

**Macro Environment:**
The Federal Reserve held rates steady in its latest meeting, maintaining a cautious stance amid persistent inflation concerns. The unchanged rate environment keeps pressure on commodity demand while supporting the dollar, which tends to weigh on dollar-denominated oil prices. Current WTI crude trades around $65/barrel, with Brent near $69—both hovering in a range constrained by oversupply concerns. Analysts project oil could average around $60 in 2025 as production gluts outweigh geopolitical risk premiums.

**Geopolitical Factors:**
Multiple geopolitical flashpoints are creating cross-currents: Iran tensions briefly spiked gold and oil volatility; the EU is considering abandoning Russia's oil price cap in favor of stricter sanctions, potentially tightening supply; Russian crude is accumulating at sea as India reduces imports under U.S. sanctions pressure; Venezuela is pursuing sanctions relief and oil law reforms to attract foreign investment. Turkey's largest refinery experienced a fire, jolting already tight refining markets. Despite these risks, OPEC+ plans to maintain March output levels, signaling confidence in demand resilience.

**Market Sentiment:**
Mixed sentiment prevails. While geopolitical risks provide a floor, structural oversupply concerns dominate. U.S. petroleum inventories fell during the recent cold snap, but record production from majors like Exxon offset bullish weather impacts. Natural gas has surged (+11% recently) on European winter demand, while oil remains range-bound.

**Sector Dynamics:**
Energy sector shows divergence: traditional oil faces oversupply headwinds while LNG/natural gas benefits from winter demand and geopolitical disruptions. China's LNG imports rose for a third consecutive month, but electric vehicle expansion (especially in trucking) poses long-term demand risks.

**Impact on OIL:**
**Neutral to slightly bearish**. Geopolitical premiums are being overwhelmed by supply glut narratives and OPEC+'s reluctance to cut production. Near-term weather disruptions provide tactical support, but the broader trend points to range-bound prices ($60-70) until demand catalysts emerge or OPEC+ shifts strategy.

**Confidence Level:** Medium-High
