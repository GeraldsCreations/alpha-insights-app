## Volume Analysis

**Today's Volume:** 92,443,408  
**Average Volume:** 46,870,000  
**Relative Volume:** 1.97x (97% above average)

**Assessment:** **STRONG ACCUMULATION**  
Volume is nearly double the daily average, indicating significant institutional interest following Apple's blowout Q1 earnings report ($143.76B revenue, best iPhone quarter ever). The elevated volume on a positive price day signals accumulation rather than distribution. This is consistent with record iPhone sales and strong China growth (+38% revenue).

## Momentum Indicators

**RSI (14):** 48.44 — **NEUTRAL**  
The RSI sits in the middle range, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This provides room for movement in either direction without immediate reversal pressure.

**Moving Averages:**
- **SMA 20:** +0.71% (price at 20-day average)
- **SMA 50:** -3.29% (price below 50-day average — short-term caution)
- **SMA 200:** +9.65% (price above 200-day average — long-term bullish)

**MACD:** Not overbought; momentum appears balanced.

**Interpretation:** AAPL is in a neutral-to-slightly-bullish momentum phase. The golden cross remains intact (price above 200-day MA), but short-term weakness is evident (below 50-day MA). The neutral RSI suggests consolidation before the next directional move.

## Unusual Activity & Institutional Flows

- **Analyst Upgrades:** Maxim Group upgraded from Hold → Buy with a $300 target (Jan 30). JP Morgan raised target from $315 → $325.
- **Insider Trading:** Recent selling by CFO Kevan Parekh (4,199 shares at $247-249) and CEO Tim Cook (129,963 shares at $256.81) in October 2025. Standard executive profit-taking.
- **Institutional Ownership:** 65.18% (high confidence from institutions)
- **Short Interest:** 0.77% (very low; minimal bearish pressure)
- **Record Earnings:** Q1 FY26 revenue of $143.76B (+16% YoY), driven by "staggering" iPhone demand, especially in China.

**Notable:** The combination of record earnings, low short interest, and multiple analyst upgrades suggests strong institutional conviction despite recent insider selling (routine executive transactions, not red flags).
