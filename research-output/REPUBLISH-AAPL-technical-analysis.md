- Head: $252.18 (Jan 30 low - intraday)
- Right shoulder: Potentially forming now around $255-258
- Neckline: ~$270-275 resistance zone

**Bollinger Band Squeeze:** Bands narrowing after the selloff, indicating reduced volatility and potential breakout coming in either direction within 1-2 weeks.

## Trend Structure

**Primary Trend:** Uptrend (above 200 MA at $257.66)  
**Intermediate Trend:** Corrective phase (below 50 MA at $268.30)  
**Short-term:** Consolidation near support

**Market Structure:**
- Failed to hold highs above $285 (lower highs forming)
- Recent bounce from $252 level shows buyers defending support

## Trade Setup

### **Primary Setup: Bullish Reversal (Inverse H&S)**

**Entry:** $257-260 (current price area - accumulation zone)  
**Alternative Entry:** $252-253 (on retest of channel support with bullish candle)

**Stop Loss:** $248 (below 200 MA, channel support, and key psychological level)  
- Risk: $9-12 per share depending on entry

**Target 1:** $272 (R:R = 1:1.5)  
- Neckline breakout + 50 MA reclaim  
- Take 50% profit, move stop to breakeven

**Target 2:** $285 (R:R = 1:3)  
- Retest of ATH zone  
- Take another 30% profit

**Target 3:** $295-300 (R:R = 1:4)  
- Extension move + analyst targets  
- Trail remaining position

**Position Sizing:** Risk 1-2% of capital  
- Example: $100K account = $1,000-2,000 risk = ~85-165 shares at $259 with $248 stop

---

### **Alternative Setup: Breakdown Short (if $250 fails)**

**Short Entry:** $247-249 (on confirmed break below 200 MA + channel support)  
**Stop Loss:** $255 (reclaim of 200 MA)  
**Target 1:** $243 (0.382 Fib - R:R 1:1)  
**Target 2:** $235 (gap fill - R:R 1:2)  
**Note:** This is a lower probability setup given strong fundamentals and analyst upgrades. Only trade with clear confirmation.

## Technical Bias

**BULLISH** (Moderate Confidence)

**Rationale:**
1. **Support Confluence:** Price holding critical 200 MA + 0.236 Fib + $255-257 zone
2. **Volume Reversal:** High volume capitulation on recent down days, bounce on strong volume
3. **Inverse H&S Pattern:** Bullish reversal pattern forming with measured move to $285+
4. **RSI Neutral:** Room to run higher (not overbought), recent oversold bounce
5. **Fundamental Catalyst:** Record Q1 earnings beat ($143.76B revenue, iPhone up 23%)
6. **Analyst Support:** Recent upgrades (JP Morgan $325 PT, Wedbush $350 PT, average $295.79)
7. **Bollinger Squeeze:** Volatility compression often precedes strong directional move
8. **Long-term Structure:** Still in primary uptrend above 200 MA (0.71% above)

**Bearish Risks:**
- Below 50 MA (short-term weakness)
- Potential death cross forming (50 MA approaching 200 MA)
- 10% off ATH (momentum concern)
- MACD bearish crossover (downside momentum)
- Broader tech rotation concerns

## Key Notes

**Important Technical Observations:**

1. **Critical Juncture:** AAPL is at a make-or-break level. The 200 MA at $257.66 has been tested multiple times. A decisive break below $250 could trigger stop losses and accelerate selling to $240-243.

2. **Earnings Catalyst:** Despite blowout earnings (EPS $1.92 vs est, iPhone revenue +23% YoY), stock didn't rally - classic "sell the news" event. This washout may have flushed out weak hands.

3. **Volume Anomaly:** 92M shares traded (2x average) on earnings day with only +0.46% gain suggests distribution by some institutions but also accumulation by others. Conflicting signals.

4. **Sector Rotation:** Tech sector underperforming recently. AAPL's relative strength vs NASDAQ could be bullish divergence.

5. **AI Concerns:** Market wants more concrete AI monetization strategy. Partnership with Google (Gemini) mentioned but limited details. This remains overhang.

6. **Supply Constraints:** Management noted memory chip shortages may impact iPhone supply. Could limit upside or create pricing power.

7. **Institutional Positioning:** 65.34% institutional ownership, recent insider selling near highs, but analysts upgrading. Mixed signals.

8. **Timeline:** Next 1-2 weeks critical. Either:
   - **Bullish:** Bounce above $265-270 triggers inverse H&S breakout to $285+
   - **Bearish:** Break below $250 opens door to $240-243 correction

**Watchlist Triggers:**
- **Go Long:** Bullish engulfing candle above $262 on volume > 60M
- **Add to Long:** Breakout above $270 with volume confirmation
- **Exit Long/Hedge:** Close below $250 on daily chart
- **Aggressive Short:** Breakdown below $248 with increasing volume

---

## Confidence Level

**MEDIUM-HIGH (70%)**

**Reasoning:** 
- Multiple support confluences at current price (200 MA, Fib, volume, channel)
- Strong fundamentals (record earnings, analyst upgrades, $325 PT from major banks)
- Bullish pattern developing (inverse H&S)
- Risk/reward favorable (1:3+ on breakout setup)

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Broader market volatility (Fed policy, macro concerns)
- Tech sector rotation out of mega-caps
- AI strategy clarity needed
- 200 MA break could trigger cascade

**Recommendation:** This is a **high-conviction long setup** at current levels ($257-260) with defined risk ($248 stop) and strong upside potential ($285-295). The 200 MA has been a reliable support throughout 2024-2025. However, position sizing should be conservative (1-2% risk) given proximity to critical support. 

**For aggressive traders:** Scale in 50% now, 50% on dip to $252-254.  
**For conservative traders:** Wait for confirmation above $265 before entry.
