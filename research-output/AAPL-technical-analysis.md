## **Final Technical Bias: NEUTRAL-TO-BULLISH**

**Current Rating:** 6/10 Bullish

**Recommendation:** AAPL is consolidating after a strong rally, forming a potential launching pad for the next leg higher. The technical structure remains constructive with price above the critical 200-day MA, but short-term momentum has cooled. Traders should wait for a clean breakout above $265-270 with volume confirmation before taking aggressive long positions. Conservative buyers can accumulate on dips toward $252-255 with tight stops below $246.

**Key Catalyst:** Breakout above $270 on strong volume would trigger buy signals and likely propel price toward $288-295 zone. Conversely, a break below $250 would invalidate the bullish setup and target $240-243 support.

**Risk Management:** Use 1-1.5 ATR ($5.50-$8.25) for stop placement. Scale positions appropriately given elevated volatility around tech earnings season.

## Next Key Technical Events
- **Earnings Catalyst:** Recent Q1 FY26 earnings (Jan 29) showed record revenue
- **Resistance Test:** Watch for volume expansion on $265+ breakout attempts
- **Support Defense:** Monitor price action at $252-255 Fibonacci zone
- **MA Convergence:** 50-day MA reclaim would signal trend resumption
