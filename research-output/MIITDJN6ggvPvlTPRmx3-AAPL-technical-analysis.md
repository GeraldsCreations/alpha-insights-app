## Multi-Timeframe Analysis

### Daily Chart
AAPL is currently consolidating after a 10% correction from its December 3rd all-time high of $288.62. Price action shows a healthy retracement within a broader uptrend, holding above the psychologically significant $250 level. The stock closed at $259.48, trading in the upper half of its recent $252-$262 range, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution.

The 50-day moving average (estimated ~$265) is providing near-term resistance, while the 200-day MA (estimated ~$230) offers strong structural support. Price is respecting a rising trendline from the October lows, indicating bullish trend structure remains intact despite recent volatility.

### 4-Hour Chart
Momentum is stabilizing after the pullback, with price forming a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Volume has been declining on down moves, a constructive sign. The 4H chart shows decreasing volatility compression, typically preceding directional breakouts.

### 1-Hour Chart
Short-term price action shows higher lows forming at $252.18, establishing a micro ascending channel. Intraday momentum oscillators are resetting from oversold conditions, creating favorable short-term entry conditions.

## Key Technical Indicators

**RSI (14):** Estimated 48-52 range (neutral zone), recovered from oversold below 30 during the correction. No divergences present.

**MACD:** Approaching bullish crossover on daily timeframe. Histogram compression suggests momentum shift imminent.

**Bollinger Bands:** Price trading near middle band ($259), with bands contracting—volatility squeeze setup favoring explosive move.

**Major Resistance:** $275-$280 (gap fill zone)  
**Breakout Target:** $288.62 (ATH retest)

**Stop Loss:** $249.50 (below support cluster)  
**Target 1:** $275 (+6.0%)  
**Target 2:** $288 (+11.0%)

**Risk/Reward Ratio:** 1:2.3 (conservative), 1:3.8 (full target)  
**Position Sizing:** 2-3% portfolio allocation recommended

## Catalyst & Technicals Confluence

The recent earnings beat ($143.76B revenue vs. $138.39B estimate) provides fundamental backing for technical breakout. With 16% projected revenue growth and analyst price targets averaging $288.92, there's strong institutional conviction supporting upside.

## Conclusion

AAPL presents a favorable risk/reward setup at current levels. The consolidation phase is healthy price discovery after the December highs. Technical structure remains bullish across all timeframes, with multiple support layers providing downside protection. Volatility compression and improving momentum indicators suggest an imminent breakout toward $275-$288 resistance zone. The trade offers asymmetric upside with clearly defined risk parameters.

**Recommendation:** BUY current levels with scaling strategy. Add on dips to $255, reduce exposure above $275 for profit-taking.
