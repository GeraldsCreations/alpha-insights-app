## Section 6: Trade Setups (3 Scenarios)

### Setup 1: Aggressive Long (Current Entry)

| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry | $428-435 | 0.236 Fib bounce, post-earnings strength |
| Stop Loss | $390 | -9.5% risk, below 200 MA + 0.382 Fib |
| Target 1 | $450 | +4.6%, 50 MA reclaim, R:R 1:0.5 |
| Target 2 | $475 | +9.5%, measured move, R:R 1:1.0 |
| Target 3 | $499 | +15%, ATH test, R:R 1:1.6 |
| Position Size | 1-2% risk | Moderate conviction given mixed signals |
| Confidence | 60% | Above 200 MA bullish, but below 50 MA bearish |

**Action Plan:**
1. Enter 40% at $430-435 (current area)
2. Add 30% on dip to $420-425 (if offered)
3. Add final 30% on breakout above $448 (confirmation)
4. Take 30% profit at Target 1, move stop to breakeven
5. Take 40% at Target 2, trail remaining 30% with $10 trailing stop

---

### Setup 2: Conservative Long (Breakout Confirmation)

| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry | $450-455 | Breakout above 50 MA + 20 MA on volume |
| Stop Loss | $425 | -5.8% risk, back below consolidation |
| Target 1 | $475 | +4.8%, measured move, R:R 1:0.8 |
| Target 2 | $499 | +10%, ATH zone, R:R 1:1.7 |
| Target 3 | $530 | +16%, extension, R:R 1:2.8 |
| Position Size | 2-3% risk | Higher conviction after confirmation |
| Confidence | 80% | Confirmed breakout significantly reduces risk |

**Action Plan:**
1. Wait for daily close above $450 on volume >80M
2. Enter 60% on first pullback to $445-448 (retest of breakout)
3. Add 40% if price holds above $450 for 3 days
4. Take 40% at Target 1, trail remaining 60%

---

### Setup 3: Breakdown Short (IF $390 Fails)

| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry | $385-388 | Break below 200 MA + 0.382 Fib on volume >85M |
| Stop Loss | $398 | -3.1% risk, reclaim of 200 MA |
| Target 1 | $365 | -5.5%, 0.500 Fib, R:R 1:1.8 |
| Target 2 | $340 | -12%, gap fill zone, R:R 1:3.9 |
| Position Size | 0.5-1% risk | Very low probability (counter-trend) |
| Confidence | 25% | Fundamentals + long-term trend don't support |

**Note:** Only execute if macro conditions deteriorate significantly (Fed hawkish, recession fears, sector rotation out of growth).

## Section 7: Technical Bias & Conviction

**BULLISH** - 60% Confidence

### Bull Case (Why Long Here):
1. ✅ **200 MA support holding strong** (+14.10% above) - critical long-term trend intact
2. ✅ **Higher low formation** - $416 low is above October $350 low (uptrend structure)
3. ✅ **Volume accumulation** - +11% spike on +3.32% gain post-earnings
4. ✅ **RSI neutral** (45.68) - significant room to run to 70+ before overbought
5. ✅ **Bollinger squeeze** - volatility compression signals imminent breakout
6. ✅ **Historical precedent** - Last 200 MA bounce rallied +103% (Aug-Dec 2025)
7. ✅ **Earnings beat** - 10.82% EPS surprise, despite revenue miss AI/robotics pivot bullish long-term
8. ✅ **Analyst upgrades** - TD Cowen raised PT to $519 (+21% upside)

### Bear Case (Risks to Watch):
1. ⚠️ **Below both 20 & 50 MA** - short-term momentum negative
2. ⚠️ **Muted earnings reaction** - Only +3.3% despite 10% EPS beat suggests skepticism
3. ⚠️ **13.7% off ATH** - momentum lost, may struggle to reclaim highs quickly
4. ⚠️ **Lower earnings volume** - 63.4M (-15% vs avg) shows cautious participation
5. ⚠️ **Bearish analyst actions** - JP Morgan lowered PT to $145 (underweight stance)
6. ⚠️ **High valuation** - P/E of 400 leaves little room for error
7. ⚠️ **Macro headwinds** - Fed policy uncertainty, EV demand concerns
8. ⚠️ **Short float** - 2.70% is manageable but shows some bearish sentiment

### What Changes the Thesis:
- **Bullish confirmation:** Break above $450 on volume >80M with RSI >55 → target $475-499
- **Bullish invalidation:** Break below $390 on volume >85M → target $365-340
- **Neutral:** Consolidation between $415-445 for >2 weeks → wait for direction
