## Price Action Summary

**Current Price:** $259.48 (Close: Jan 30, 2026)  
**After-Hours:** $258.99 (-0.19%)

Apple closed at $259.48 on January 30th, marking a modest +0.46% gain with significant institutional participation. The stock is trading approximately 10% below its 52-week high of $288.62, positioning in the middle-to-upper range of its annual trading band ($169.21-$288.62).

## Volume Analysis

**Daily Volume:** 79.61M shares  
**Average Volume:** 46.59M shares  
**Volume Spike:** +71% above average

Thursday's session saw exceptional volume, exceeding the 50-day average by 71%—a clear signal of heightened institutional activity. This elevated participation followed earnings reports and suggests strong conviction behind the move, though the relatively modest price gain (+$1.20) indicates measured accumulation rather than panic buying.

## Technical Position

The intraday range of $252.18-$261.90 established key short-term boundaries. The stock defended the $252 support zone—a critical technical level coinciding with the previous week's consolidation base. Resistance emerges at the $262 level, with stronger overhead supply expected near $270.

## Momentum Assessment

Price action reveals constructive momentum. The combination of elevated volume, higher close, and defense of support suggests buyers maintain control. However, the 10% gap to 52-week highs indicates overhead supply remains a factor. The stock's +4.55% YTD performance outpaces the S&P 500 (+1.37%), reflecting relative strength.

## Bias

**BULLISH** with cautious optimism. Volume expansion on updays, support-holding behavior, and post-earnings stability signal accumulation. Near-term target: $270-$275 retest zone. Watch for volume continuation above $262 for breakout confirmation.
